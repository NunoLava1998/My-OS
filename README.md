# My-OS
My operating system.


It's easy to build this. Get a i686-elf (32bit ELF) compiler (you can either build *that* yourself or download it from the internet) and assembler, then compile all of the .c and .s files in here, link all of them together and then construct that into an .iso!

An .iso is also available from the "releases" part of this project.
